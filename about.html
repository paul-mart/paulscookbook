        <p class="about">Hello! My name is Paul Martin, I am a 19 year old second year student at Quincy College. I study Computer Science: Programming, and some of my hobbies
            include cooking, baking, and programming. In November of 2022, I decided to combine these hobbies and create an online food blog.
            This blog would be a place where I could not only practice my newfound web design skills and express my creativity, but a place to share my delicous recipes and teach others how to make them.
            I am planning on updating this website everytime I cook something that I deem "web-worthy", as I will write down my detailed instructions, ingredients, and my favorite part, take lots of pictures.
            <br><br>
            I first began cooking at the beginning of my weight loss journey in September of 2020. At this point in my life, I wanted to learn a new skill and better my body physically at the time.
            I began my cooking journey by making low calorie meals such as chicken and rice, beef and broccoli, and veggie wraps; however, I only began to find my true love for cooking when I began to cook whatever I wanted, rather than to just assist my weight loss journey.
            Eventually, with the help of my father, I began to expand my horizons in the kitchen. My father, who is an amazing cook himself, aided me in diving into the basics of cooking. My father showed me proper cutting techniques, walked me through his favorite recipes, and showed me how to get the best flavor out of your ingredients. 
           
            After improving my skils in the kitchen, I began to start cooking for events with my friends and family, and documented many of these recipes with photos and notes.
            That is currently wher I stand now, trying out new recipes and documenting them everyday, and with my wed development, cooking, and photography skills, I hope to bring my plate to you.
            Now, go enjoy the food! <br>
