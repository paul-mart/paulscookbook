        <p class="instructions">
            <b>1. </b>First season your steak however you like, but for this recipe, I will use just salt and pepper to taste.
            <br> <b>2. </b>Add a drizzle of olive oil to a pan on high heat and add your steak when the pan begins to smoke.
            <br><b>3. </b>After 45 seconds of searing, add your butter, rosemary, and thyme to the pan. Baste the steak with these ingredients periodically while the steak is searing continues to cook.<br>
            <b>4. </b>For a medium rare steak, you should flip the steak after about 3-4 minutes and begin the sear on the other side. After you flio the first time, add the garlic to the pan as well and continue basting the steak.<br>
            <b>5. </b>After about 3-4 minutes on each side, about 7 minutes total, or until the steaks temperature has reached 131ºF, the steak should be medium rare. If you wish for a temperature other than medium rare, click <a href="https://steakschool.com/learn/steak-temperature-chart/"><u>here</u></a> for instructions. Take your steak out the pan when it is cooked to your prefered temperature and let it rest for at least 5 minutes. </br>
            <b>6. </b>While the steak is resting put your fries, frozen or homemade, in a fryolator, oven, air fryer, or prefered cooking appliance and begin cooking. If you are using a fryolator like me, I recommend 350ºF for 7 minutes. To make the fries crispier, take them out halfway cooked, let the oil raise back up to temperature and cook them the remainder of the way. <br>
            <b>7. </b>Plate your steak with your french fries. (Optional) Spoon chimichurri sauce onto your steak as pictured above. I used <a href="https://cafedelites.com/authentic-chimichurri-uruguay-argentina/"><u>this recipe</u></a> if you are interested in making some.
            <br><b>8. </b>Sprinkle salt on your fries and Enjoy!<br>
