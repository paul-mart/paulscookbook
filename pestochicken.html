        <p class="instructions">
            <b>1. </b>Firstly, start boiling water for your pasta. When the water begins to boil, add your pasta. Take the pot off the heat and strain in about 9 minutes (This time may differ depending on pasta type).
            <br> <b>2. </b>While the pasta is cooking lets begin making our pesto sauce. Grab a food processor and throw in your basil leaves and peeled garlic cloves, processing them until finely minced. You can also add pinenuts here if you wish.
            <br><b>3. </b>Next, add the oil and parmesan cheese into the food processor. Process this until smooth, season to taste with salt and pepper, and the pesto sauce is now done.<br>
            <b>4. </b>We can now begin preparing our chicken breasts. First, pat then chicken breasts dry with a paper towel, and then flatten them out to your desired thickness. Once this is done, season with salt, pepper, onion powder, garlic powder, and oregano to taste.<br>
            <b>5. </b>Once the chicken breasts are seasoned, we can take the next step in preparing them. Now you can begin making your eggwash and breadcrumb coating. For the egg wash, whisk 2 eggs in a bowl and season lightly with salt and pepper. For the breadcrumb coating, combine the italian breadcrumbs, flour, salt, pepper, oregano, garlic powder, and onion powder into a bowl and mix until combined.</br>
            <b>6. </b>To finish preparing the chicken, dip the chicken breasts in the egg wash, and then put them in the breadcrumb coating mixture, making sure that the whole cutlet is covered with the coating.<br>
            <b>7. </b>Now that the chicken breasts are prepared, add them into a pan with olive oil on medium low heat. Cook the chicken breasts until they are fully cooked in the middle and golden brown on the outside.<br>
            <b>8. </b>Using the same pan, remove the chicken breasts and add in your pasta, pesto sauce, and chopped cherry tomatoes. Saute the pasta, sauce, and tomatoes together for a minute or two on low heat, then put this on a plate and place the chicken cutlet on top of the pasta, Enjoy! <br>
